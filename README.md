# dagger-mvvm-rx-lab
A lab project to test some libraries and techniques

This app consumes an API of Imovirtual, an app to find places for buy or rental in Portugal.

The API works over http and can be seen through any proxy. In my case, I used the Charles Proxy to see how the communication between app and API works.
